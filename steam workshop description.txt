[h1]PIMS[/h1]
"Persistent Inventory Management System - PIMS" is an attempt to offer persistent inventory Units a easy tool to manage the inventories and money of their players.
This is done by storing the inventories of the players on a mySQL database.
If anyone ever wants to use this mod for their server or unit, reach out to me, i am willing to help.

[h2]Key Features[/h2]
[list]
[*] [b]Persistent Storage[/b] - Items stored in PIMS containers are saved to a database and persist across server restarts
[*] [b]Permission System[/b] - Control which players can access which inventories via database permissions
[*] [b]Money System[/b] - Physical money items that convert to digital balance when deposited, withdraw as physical items
[*] [b]Transaction Logging[/b] - All item deposits and withdrawals are logged to the database
[*] [b]High Performance[/b] - Native C# extension handles database operations (10-100x faster than pure SQF)
[/list]

[h1]REQUIREMENTS[/h1]
[list]
[*] Dedicated server
[*] MySQL or MariaDB server
[*] ACE 3
[*] CBA_A3
[*] .NET 8.0 Runtime (x64) on the server
[/list]

[h1]Setup[/h1]

[h3]1. Install the Mod[/h3]
Subscribe to this mod. Clients only need the addon, the DLL and config are server-side only.

[h3]2. Configure Database Connection[/h3]
Create [b]pims_config.json[/b] in the Arma 3 root directory (same folder as arma3server.exe):
[code]
{
  "database": {
    "server": "localhost",
    "database": "pims_db",
    "user": "pims_user",
    "password": "your_secure_password",
    "port": 3306
  }
}
[/code]

[h3]3. Set Up Database[/h3]
Create the database and required tables using the SQL queries provided in the GitHub repository or the included [b]database_setup.txt[/b] file.

[h3]4. Add Players and Inventories[/h3]
Create inventories:
[code]INSERT INTO inventories (inventory_id, inventory_name, inventory_money) VALUES (1, 'Team Alpha Storage', 0);[/code]

Grant player access (use their Steam64 ID):
[code]INSERT INTO permissions (Inventory_Id, Player_Id) VALUES (1, '76500111122233344');[/code]


[h3]5. Mission Editor Setup[/h3]
In the Eden Editor you will find 2 modules under [b]Modules → PIMS[/b]:
[list]
[*] [b]PIMS Init[/b] - Place exactly one per mission (required)
[*] [b]PIMS Add Inventory[/b] - Place for each storage location, set the Inventory ID, and sync to the container object
[/list]

[h1]Money System[/h1]
PIMS includes a currency system with physical money items:
[list]
[*] PIMS_Money_1 (1 Credit)
[*] PIMS_Money_10 (10 Credits)
[*] PIMS_Money_50 (50 Credits)
[*] PIMS_Money_100 (100 Credits)
[*] PIMS_Money_500 (500 Credits)
[*] PIMS_Money_1000 (1000 Credits)
[/list]
[b]Upload[/b] physical money → Converts to digital balance
[b]Withdraw[/b] from balance → Spawns physical money items in the container

[h1]Player Usage[/h1]
Players interact with PIMS containers via the action menu:

[h3]Open Menu[/h3]
Opens the inventory GUI where players can view stored items, retrieve items from the database, and manage their money balance.

[h3]Upload Inventory[/h3]
All items in the container will be removed and stored in the database. Money items are converted to balance.

[h1]Logging & Debugging[/h1]
The extension produces two log files in the Arma 3 root directory:
[list]
[*] [b]PIMS_logs.txt[/b] - General logs (commands, responses, debug info)
[*] [b]PIMS_errors.txt[/b] - Error logs (database errors, exceptions)
[/list]

[h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b]"Database not initialized"[/b] - Check pims_config.json exists and has correct credentials
[*] [b]Version mismatch warning[/b] - Ensure client and server have the same mod version
[*] [b]No actions on container[/b] - Verify the PIMS Add Inventory module is synced to the object
